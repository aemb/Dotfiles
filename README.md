# .vimrc

Ispired by @MaxSt. That .vimrc is incredible, almost perfect. I have added some features.
You can diff with @MaxSt one [here](https://github.com/MaxSt/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc).
I wish that `<C-h>` will work soon on @Neovim for moving the cursor left in insert mode.
That's the only work left to be done on this .vimrc according to my needs and maybe some Meteor.js support.
